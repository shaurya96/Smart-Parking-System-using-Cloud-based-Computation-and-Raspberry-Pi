# Smart-Parking-System-using-Cloud-based-Computation-and-Raspberry-Pi

The research paper titled "Smart Parking System using Cloud based Computation and Raspberry Pi" presents a solution to the growing problem of urban parking congestion using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The paper outlines the development of a smart parking system that enables users to locate and reserve parking spaces within a city, thereby reducing time spent searching for parking and decreasing fuel consumption and pollution.

The system employs a combination of hardware components including Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and RFID technology, along with software components such as Node.js, Socket.io, and MongoDB. The architecture of the system consists of three main parts: Raspberry Pi application, cloud application, and client application.

The Raspberry Pi application monitors parking spaces using ultrasonic sensors and communicates data to the cloud application, which processes the information and manages user requests. The client application, accessible via a progressive web app, allows users to find and reserve parking spaces, as well as navigate to their selected location using Google Maps.

The system relies on real-time communication between the Raspberry Pi and cloud application using WebSocket protocol, while communication between the cloud application and client application is secured using HTTPS protocol.

The paper also discusses the implementation details including hardware setup, software development, server setup, and database schema. Additionally, it outlines the workflow of the system, from user authentication to parking reservation and billing.

The research acknowledges the support and guidance of Dr. Debopam Acharya and Dr. Divya Lohani, and references several related works in the field of smart parking systems.

Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive solution to urban parking challenges using IoT technology, with potential benefits for reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and enhancing the user experience.
